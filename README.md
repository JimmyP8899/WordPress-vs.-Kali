# WordPress-vs.-Kali
While doing the lab I ran into some problems with my kali machine, I was unable to solve them in time 
with the extension. These are the steps I have completed successfully. I will link a gif of the problem with
my kali machine.

I was able to:
  1. install vagrant
  2. Download WPDistillery
  3. Configure WPDistillery
  4.
