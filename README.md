# WordPress-vs.-Kali
While doing the lab I ran into some problems with my kali machine, I was unable to solve them in time with the extension. These are the steps I have completed successfully. I will link a gif of the problem with my kali machine.

I was able to:
  1. install vagrant
  2. Download WPDistillery
  3. Configure WPDistillery
  4. ping the wordpress virtual machine

Problem:
  Kali machine boots just fine, but after I try to login, it freezes on the desktop. I wasn't able to figure out the problem in time, so I attached some gif recordings of the process I went through before finding this error.
